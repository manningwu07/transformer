Scale up to 100M param models using metal pytorch
Ultimately I could do better though with CUDA Hardware

However, I did stumble upon MLX => 5x increase in TPS + huge reduction in memory so may need to stress test this again soon
For now Im working on my 1B param model; this will go into the github backlogs though
