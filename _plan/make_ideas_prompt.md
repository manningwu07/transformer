Generate 20 diverse, stream-of-consciousness project ideas formatted as messy human input. Each should be 300-500 tokens. Style: technical jargon mixed with casual language, tangents, asides, questions, uncertainty. Focus on realistic software engineering/AI/infrastructure projects.

Format each as plain text (no JSON, no formatting, no bullet points, no numbered list, nothing else but plain text). Separate each example with ===== (no \n before or after) on its own line.

Requirements:
- Sound like a tired person thinking out loud
- Include off-topic remarks ("btw", "oh and also", "wait what", "nvm")
- Mix specific constraints with vague ideas
- Include questions and uncertainty ("should I...", "is X better than Y?", "idk if this works")
- Natural misspellings/abbreviations: "asw" for "as well", "j" for "just", "w/" or "w" for "with", "ur" for "your"
- Tangents and incomplete thoughts are good
- Include realistic constraints: budget, time, resources, skills
- Each example should be a complete messy thought
- Use casual profanity if it fits (keep it real)

DOMAIN DISTRIBUTION:
- 30-40%: Engineering/CS/Math/AI projects
- 20-25%: Business/startup ideas
- 15-20%: Cooking/food/recipe planning
- 10-15%: Creative projects (writing, design, music, art)
- 10-15%: Personal/lifestyle (fitness, learning, organization, events)
- 5-10%: Scientific/research ideas

Example style (you can reuse structure but change projects):
ENGINEERING: "Okay so I want to build this thing that basically takes user input and converts it to structured output, right? Like a parser but smarter. Maybe use transformers? But idk if I need a massive model or if something 100M params would work. I have like $500 budget and 3 weeks. Data is messy, probably need to scrape it from... somewhere? Reddit? HuggingFace? Also need inference to be fast, like under 100ms per request. Should I use quantization or just go full bfloat16? And do I deploy on cloud or local GPU?"

BUSINESS: "So I've been thinking about starting this subscription service for like meal prepping or something? Basically customers pay monthly and I send them pre-portioned ingredients w/ recipes. But I'd need to figure out logistics, like how to ship stuff without it spoiling. Also idk the margins on this... probably tight? And I'd need maybe $10k to start? Or is that too low. Should I start local or try to scale right away. Also need to figure out marketing asw, don't have budget for ads really."

COOKING: "Alright so I'm trying to make this restaurant-quality pasta from scratch but like... I don't have a pasta maker? Can I use a rolling pin? And idk the exact ratios for the dough, like should it be wetter or drier? Also trying to make like 5 different sauces to go w it but I'm worried they'll all taste similar or something. Maybe I'm overthinking this. Budget is like $20 and I have 2 hours before guests arrive. Should I just buy pasta ngl."

CREATIVE: "Okay so I have this idea for a novel but it's like... sci-fi mixed with romance? And I don't really know how to structure it. Should I write the romance first then layer the sci-fi worldbuilding on top? Or is that backwards? I'm terrible at planning stories. Also I don't have much time, maybe 2-3 months to write a draft? And I'm not even sure if the premise is good tbh. Like, would ppl actually care about a story w aliens and... idk, maybe love triangles?"

PERSONAL/LIFESTYLE: "So I want to get fit right? But like... I hate the gym. Maybe I should just do home workouts? Or running? But it's cold outside rn and I live in an apt so can't make noise. I have like 45 mins a day max. Should I follow a program or just wing it? Also my diet is shit, should I fix that first or start working out? Idk man, motivation is hard lol."
